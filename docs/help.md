# Help & Features Guide

For a feature overview see `/features`.

Each article has:

- **Content** — rich text body written in the Tiptap editor
- **Category** — optional, for organizing articles into groups
- **Tags** — optional labels for cross-cutting topics
- **Excerpt** — short summary shown in search results and article lists
- **Status** — Draft (admin-only), Review, or Published (visible to all)

---

The rich text editor provides a toolbar with formatting options:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **B / I / S** | Bold, Italic, Strikethrough |
| **H1 / H2 / H3** | Heading levels |
| **• / 1.** | Bullet and ordered lists |
| **"** | Blockquote |

**Slash commands:** Type `/` anywhere in the editor to open the command palette. Commands include: Mermaid diagram, Math block, Excalidraw drawing, Data table, Decision tree, and all heading/list types.

**Markdown mode:** Click `Markdown` to switch to raw markdown editing. Click `Rich Text` to switch back.

**Templates:** When creating a new article, choose from predefined templates (Person, Place, Event, Thing, Group) that provide a starting structure with an infobox and sections.

---

## Rich Content Blocks

Beyond standard text, the editor supports specialized content blocks inserted via slash commands:

- **Mermaid diagrams** — write `graph TD; A-->B` syntax; renders as a flowchart, sequence diagram, Gantt chart, etc. on the article page
- **Math (KaTeX)** — inline math with `$...$` and block math with `$$...$$`
- **Excalidraw** — embed an interactive whiteboard drawing; stored as JSON and rendered read-only on the article page
- **Data table** — paste CSV or JSON data to create a sortable, filterable table with a CSV download button
- **Decision tree** — define a yes/no tree as JSON; renders as an interactive SVG with expand/collapse

**Voice dictation:** Click the microphone button in the toolbar to speak — your words are inserted at the cursor using the browser's speech recognition.

---

## Presentation Mode

Click **Present** in the article action bar to open the article as a slideshow. Each H2 / H3 heading becomes a new slide. Use arrow keys or click to advance. Press Esc to exit.
